Years ago I wrote these LaTeX macros for myself
 * `pdfpages_1pagemerger.tex` facilitate merging scanned pdf files of 1 page into one.
 * `pdfpages_widow.tex`: add small portion, such as one line, of pdf page 2 on page 1. Parameters must be found manually.
 * `pdfpages-2x1.tex`: print two pages on one
